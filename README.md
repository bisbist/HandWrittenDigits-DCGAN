# Handwritten Digits Generation with DCGAN 🖋️🤖

![Generated Digits Sample](assets/digits_sample.gif) 
*Example of digits generated by the DCGAN*

A simple yet powerful implementation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic handwritten digits. This project is created to understand GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) theory and mathematics behind it.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a DCGAN that learns to generate realistic handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The implementation focuses on:

- Understanding GAN theory through practical implementation
- Visualizing the training progression with a training_progress.gif

## 🧠 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Generator | Creates synthetic images from random noise |
| Discriminator | Distinguishes real vs. fake images |
| Adversarial Training | The two networks compete and improve each other |
| Latent Space | The compressed representation the generator learns |

## 🏗️ Architecture

```python
Generator:
Input(100) → Dense(7*7*256) → Reshape(7,7,256) → Conv2DTranspose(128) → Conv2DTranspose(64) → Output(28,28,1)

Discriminator:
Input(28,28,1) → Conv2D(64) → Conv2D(128) → Flatten() → Output(1)
